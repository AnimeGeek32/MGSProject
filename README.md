MGSProject is an Unreal Engine project created by me with the intent of implementing
basic functionality from the original Metal Gear Solid for the PS1.

As of now the functionality includes:
  - Cover mechanic
  - Inventory and Items
  - Basic AI
  - Radar System
 
There is a ToDo list if you want to contribute.
