MGSProject is an Unreal Engine project created by me with the intent of implementing
basic functionality from the Metal Gear Solid franchise.

As of now the functionality includes:
  - Cover mechanic
  - Crouch and prone mechanic
  - Inventory system
  - Basic AI patrolling and attacking
  - Radar System
  - OctoCamo mechanic
 
There is a ToDo list if you want to contribute.
